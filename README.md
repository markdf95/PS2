# PS2
Web API Service with Angular Client

This project was developed in Visual Studio 2017 and contains the *complete* solution.  There are 3 projects, PS2 (web api service), PS2UnitTest, and PS2Web (Angular 4 client).  
There is a single .zip for PS2 and a single .zip for PS2UnitTest.

PS2Web is large because it required node.js.  The files that belong in the PS2Web project folder are
  PS2Web.sln
  bin.zip
  Controllers.zip
  node_modules1.zip
  node_modules2.zip
  obj.zip
  Properties.zip
  Views.zip
  wwwroot.zip
  PS2WebJSON.zip
  
  I didn't have time to build an installer for the web service or client so here is eveything.  
  
  I've uploaded a screen shot of the project folder structure to recreate the VS2017 solution folder hierarchy.
